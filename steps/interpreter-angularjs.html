<h2>Interpreter AngularJS</h2>

<p class="small">
  AngularJS has its own interpreter of a DSL (modified subset of JavaScript), for expressions, which are embeddable in the partials.
</p>
<div class="small">
  <br>
  <pre lang="JavaScript">
  (foo) ? bar : baz | toUpperCase
  </pre>

  <pre lang="javascript">
  //Responsible for converting given string into tokens
  var Lexer;
  //Responsible for parsing the tokens and evaluating the expression
  var Parser;

  var OPERATORS = {
    '%':function(self, locals, a,b){return a(self, locals)%b(self, locals);},
    '^':function(self, locals, a,b){return a(self, locals)^b(self, locals);},
    //...
  };
  </pre>
</div>
