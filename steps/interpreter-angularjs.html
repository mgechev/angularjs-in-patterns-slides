<h2>Interpreter AngularJS</h2>

<p class="small">
  AngularJS has its own interpreter of a DSL (modified subset of JavaScript), for expressions, which are embeddable in the partials.
</p>
<div class="small">
  <br>
  <pre lang="JavaScript"><code>(foo) ? bar : baz | toUpperCase</code></pre>
<br>
  <pre lang="javascript"><code>//Responsible for converting given string into tokens
var Lexer;
//Responsible for parsing the tokens and evaluating the expression
var Parser;

var OPERATORS = {
  '%':function(self, locals, a,b){return a(self, locals)%b(self, locals);},
  '^':function(self, locals, a,b){return a(self, locals)^b(self, locals);},
  //...
};</code></pre>
</div>
