<h3>Singleton in AngularJS</h3>

<p class="small">
How AngularJS resolves dependencies:
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
  <li>Takes its name and makes a lookup at a hash map, which is defined into a lexical closure (so it has a private visibility).</li>
  <li>If the dependency exists AngularJS pass it as parameter to the component, which requires it.</li>
  <li>
    If the dependency does not exists:
    <ul>
      <li>AngularJS instantiate it by calling the factory method of its provider (i.e. $get).</li>
      <li>AngularJS caches it inside the hash map mentioned above.</li>
      <li>AngularJS passes it as parameter to the component, which requires it.</li>
    </ul>
